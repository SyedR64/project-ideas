## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

## Project Idea: VandyMeetsBagel

On a campus as large and vast as Vanderbilt, it can feel isolating sometimes, especially among new students or those that are still getting adjusted to the social scene at Vanderbilt. In turn this creates a barrier for students to make friends and create camaraderie.

VandyMeetsBagel will be a mobile application that will allow students to grab breakfast, lunch, or dinner at a place on campus with someone close to them in distance, that is also using the application. The application would be great for students that mightâ€™ve not had plans to grab food with someone such as a first year student who is new on campus, and allow them to connect to a student that also wants to grab food on a specific part of campus within a close radius. This application would allow our students to form friendships and build connections among our students in order to create a more perfect community.
